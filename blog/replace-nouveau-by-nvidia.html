    <title>A2N - devlog - Replace nouveau by nvidia</title>

    <h1><a href="../index.html"><</a> Replace nouveau by nvidia</h1>

    <p>
        Last week I had display problems on an external screen (2560 * 1440), the image was "cut" in the diagonal during certain movements and I had inputs lags.
        After looking at my settings I realized that I had reinstalled EOS with "nouveau" as graphics driver.
    </p>

    <p>
        Having a Lenovo laptop (Legion Y530-151CH) I have an NVIDIA and Intel card.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can check this with the command <code class="code">lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)"</code> which lists the two options available to me:
    </p>


    <div class="code">
        00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation CoffeeLake-H GT2 [UHD Graphics 630] <br/>
        Subsystem: Lenovo CoffeeLake-H GT2 [UHD Graphics 630] <br/>
        Kernel driver in use: i915 <br/>
        -- <br/>
        01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GP107M [GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Mobile] (rev a1) <br/>
        Subsystem: Lenovo GP107M [GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Mobile] <br/>
        Kernel driver in use: nouveau <br/>
    </div>

    <p>
        I see here that I actually use "nouveau" for the NVIDIA card.
    </p>

    <p>By going to the settings and then to "about this system" I can see that the card used is from "intel".</p>

    <img src="../img/screen1.png" alt="capture d'écran de la fenetre a propos de ce systéme dans endeavour os">

    <p>On the EOS website we can see that they offer a package from their repo that allows you to manage the installation of NVIDIA plugins in a quick and easy way. (<a
            href="https://discovery.endeavouros.com/nvidia/new-nvidia-driver-installer-nvidia-inst/2022/03/">https://discovery.endeavouros.com/nvidia/new-nvidia-driver-installer-nvidia-inst/2022/03/</a>)</p>

    <p>So I simply installed this package via their repo:</p>

    <div class="code">
        sudo pacman -S nvidia-inst
    </div>

    <p>Then simply run <code class="code">nvidia-inst</code></p>

    <p>The advantage is that this package takes care of regenerating everything by itself, like for example the <code class="code">initramfs</code>, in our case with dracut.</p>

    <p>If you ever have trouble with this build you can use the <code class="code">nvidia-hook</code> package to manually rebuild.</p>

    <div class="code">
        sudo pacman -S nvidia-hook <br/>
        sudo dracut-rebuild
    </div>

    <p>Here you must not forget to reboot so that everything is well loaded!</p>

    <p>For the moment we are still using the wrong card (checkable in the settings) but the driver used is the right one:</p>

    <div class="code">
        lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)" <br/>
        <br/>
        01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GP107M [GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Mobile] (rev a1) <br/>
        Subsystem: Lenovo GP107M [GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Mobile] <br/>
        Kernel driver in use: nvidia
    </div>

    <p>Because my computer offers me two cards I can choose which one I want to use. For this I can use a number of packages, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA_Optimus">See the wiki.</a></p>

    <p>For my part I chose <code class="code">envycontrol</code> because it is natively supported by NVIDIA. The package is contained in the AUR.</p>

    <div class="code">
        yay -S envycontrol
    </div>

    <p>I don't have any worries about the life of my battery (the PC is not really meant to be unplugged since the battery is dead anyway) so I chose to use only the NVIDIA card.</p>
    <p>If you want to implement this solution and optimize your battery it is better to configure this package to automatically choose between NVIDIA and intel depending on the program used.
        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA_Optimus">See the wiki.</a>
    </p>

    <p>For my part I just ran the following command:</p>

    <div class="code">
        sudo envycontrol -s nvidia
    </div>

    <p>For more options you can check the repo on github :<a
            href="https://github.com/bayasdev/envycontrol">https://github.com/bayasdev/envycontrol</a></p>

    <p>Then we have to reboot and here we are using the NVIDIA card.</p>
